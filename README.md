**Time Spent**
Ezra Lieblich: 9/15/16-10/3/16, 40 hours
Christopher Lu: 9/15/16-10/3/16, 30 hours
Eric Song: 9/15/16-10/3/16, ~30 hours

**Role/Contributions**
Ezra Lieblich: In charge of all XO logic and simulation parts. Worked primarily on UI classes like CellGraph, Toolbar,
SliderProperties and all their respecitve children. Also worked on GridView parent class. Refactored and 
worked with GridController to handle interaction between UI and simulation.  
Christopher Lu: Game of Life, Spread of Fire, XML parsing and XML files, Error checking and alert boxes for XML files.
Eric Song: Designed overall initial structure of project with MVC in mind, all logic of predator-prey (WaTor World) simulation,
backend and visualizations of square, triangular, and hexagonal grids, backend of finite and toroidal grid, exception handling
and default value assignment for all missing parameters for simulations, factories for each type of simulation, multiple neighbor types
(cardinal, all, or diagonal), some work with XML files, GridController and interfacing with logic classes.

Duke CompSci 308 Cell Society Project

**Files Used To Start the Project**
Main.java

**Files Used To Test the Project**
NotAnXML.txt: Should throw error saying that file is not an XML file.
data/xml has all of our test files for sims

**Required Data/Resource Files**
resource/ contains properties files for strings used in view as well as a css file for 
formatting

**Known Bugs**
We have not finished implementing feature that allows XML to specify individual locations so 
GameOfLifeH.xml does not work currently

**Extra Info/Easter Eggs**
User has the ability to delete simulations if they want and view updates and shifts everything
XML .

**Impressions Of Assignment**
Ezra: I really enjoyed this assignment and the challenges it presented. In the future I think having a balance
between Sprint 2 and 3 would be better as I thought Sprint 3 had significantly more features to implement.
Also I know there was purposely a lot of features and it was hard to do all them so maybe you could reccomend
good features to work on that would affirm concepts we are learning in class the most.

Christopher: CellSociety was a new and interesting experience for me. I learned a lot about class interaction and front end and back end interaction, and I felt that this assignment really showed off the power and importance of controllers.
In the future, this assignment could be improved by either providing less new features to deal with in Sprint 3, or unveiling more of the new features in Sprint 2 to provide more of a balance between the two weeks.

Eric: I learned a great deal about working on a project on a team, as it
presents many different challenges such as communication and integration of
code, which were not present in the first assignment. Despite Duvall's constant
talk of never sacrificing quality of code for amount of features, I believe
we would improve as software developers much more if we were given a smaller list of 
features and much more emphasis on strictly following the rules of good software design.
